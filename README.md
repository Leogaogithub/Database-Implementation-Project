# Library_Mangement_System
Description
This SQL programming project involves the creation of a database host application that
interfaces with a backend SQL database implementing a Library Management System. Users of
the system are understood to be librarians (not book borrowers).

Following is a brief description about the working of the system:

Search a Book - Allows the user to search any book given any combination of Book id and/or Book Title and /or Book Author. 
Checkout a Book â€“ Allows a user to check-out the book from a branch based on its availability and book borrowers credibility. 
Checkin a Book - Allows a user to check-in the book. This feature first searches for all the book loans the borrower has taken which are not checked-in yet and then allows the user to check in the selected the book. 
Add New Borrower - Allows the user to add a new borrower to the library loan system. 
Fine - This feature allows two types of fine computation.
